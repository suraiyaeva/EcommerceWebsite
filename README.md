# Webtech Project

### Objective

To develop API-based websites to simulate the functionalities of e-commerce services among different organisations.

### Initial Settings

1. The e-commerce organisation only sells three products.
2. These products are supplied by the supplier after its corresponding charges are transacted via the bank from the e-commerce organisation.
3. A user can buy any amount of these three products from the e-commerce website after making a successful transaction via the bank.
